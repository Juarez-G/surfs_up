# Surfs Up - Temp Analysis - Oahu, HI

## Overview of Analysis
W. Avy likes the analysis so far, but he wants more information about temperature trends before opening the surf shop. Specifically, he wants temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.  Using June and December will provide a 6 month spread to target the warmest time of the year and what a "cold" month would look like for business.

## Summary
Based on the data summarized for June and December, it's fair to say that while the range of observed temperatures daily can vary between 21 ℉ - 27 ℉ the overall monthly average only varies about 3.9 ℉.  The overall monthly average difference would not be a huge cause of concern for having the Surf & Ice Cream shop operate year round.  

### Additional Queries

* It would be beneficial to query percipitation amounts for both June and December as that will affect surfing business but could increase ice cream business so that could offset the risk.

* Target location would require a query based on the data from the closest station(s).  Summary statistics to pin point average, max and minimum temps should be reviewed prior to solidifying a location for the Surf & Ice Cream shop.
