# Surfs Up - Temp Analysis - Oahu, HI

## Overview of the analysis
W. Avy likes the analysis so far, but he wants more information about temperature trends before opening the surf shop. Specifically, he wants temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.  Using June and December will provide a 6 month spread to target the warmest time of the year and what a "cold" month would look like for business.
